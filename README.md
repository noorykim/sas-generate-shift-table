# Generating a shift from baseline table using multidimensional arrays and PROC FCMP

## Abstract
A shift from baseline table, also known as a shift table, is an n-by-n matrix in which the row and column positions correspond respectively to a category before and after a time point and/or treatment. 

This paper will discuss (1) a way to tally the count data for a shift table using a multidimensional array and (2) a way to calculate percentages for a shift table using matrix operations built into the SAS Function Compiler (PROC FCMP), which (unlike PROC IML) is part of Base SAS.
